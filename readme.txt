ABC is an application made for strick use of decommenting any code file, it can be performed with the
following steps:
1, Run "abc.exe"
2, Insert the file name in the first prompt ("Please insert file name:"), that needs to be 
	decommented, make sure the file exists in the same directory as abc.exe
3, Press Enter
4, Now add a new file name that will be created to write a comment free code...make sure to include
	an existing file format (.c, .txt etc).
5, Press Enter and as you do the window will close and you will notice a new file with a name you gave on step 4.
6, NOTICE!! We sure did de-comment the damn thing!

REMINDER: This app only works for programming languages like java and C, 
	which have a comment starting with // or /*....*/. Doesn't include HTML or any other format.
